# Baseball

My favorite sport is baseball.

One of the first things I learned about baseball was how to fill out a [scorecard](http://www.baseballscorecard.com/downloads/Scorecard-v.pdf).

The goal of this project is to visualize players seasons and careers as if they were filed out on a scorecard. This should be an interesting way to visualize players successes and failures at the plate.

So far I have written Python files to parse the data files available at Retrosheets.com and upload them into my database. I am current working to learn more about database design, SQL and the Django ORM to more effiecntly construct and query the database as there are milions of results to search through.
