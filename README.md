# Baseball

This is a fun project for me to mess around with displaying players plate apperances in the context of seasons and careers.  The goal is to group plate apprances into games and then seasons and to display each plate apperance as if it were scored on a baseball scorecard.  

So far I have written Python files to parse the data files available at Retrosheets.com and upload them into my database.  I am having issues with efficiently querying the database so I may need to reconfigure that or figure out how to write more efficient quesrys.
